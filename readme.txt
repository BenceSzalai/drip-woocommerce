Drip is a sales and marketing automation platform designed specifically for eCommerce.

== Description ==

Drip is a sales and marketing automation platform designed specifically for eCommerce. We call it an ECRM—the eCommerce customer relationship management platform you need to keep customers close.

Send personalized emails when a customer views products on your site but doesn’t purchase. Retarget customers on Facebook when they start a checkout but don’t complete it. Encourage repeat purchases with tailored product recommendations. Understand which marketing strategies are driving revenue, and which aren’t. With Drip’s ECRM, you can connect customers’ real-life actions to tailored omnichannel marketing strategies.
